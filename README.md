# Pokémon Red/Green/Blue - NC Revision

This is a ROM hack that aims to enhance the graphics of the  Pokémon Red, Green, and Blue for the Gameboy, whilst still maintaining the general artstyle of the game and better reflecting Ken Sugimori's designs featured in the game's promotional art. Also, the names for the towns and human characters have been reverted back to their Japanese versions, as I felt that would make sense for a region based on one located in real-world Japan. (With the exception of Lt.Surge for the most part. As he's American with a non-Japanese name in the Japanese version, and I personally find the name Lt. Surge to sound far cooler than Matisse. Besides, perhaps Matisse could be thought of as his first name with Surge being his surname. Though, I have referred to him as "Lt. Matisse Surge" on the Gym sign in Vermilion/Kuchiba city.) Also included, is an additional version of the hack that allows the player to play as a girl. This hack is a labour of love for a game that I hold so dearly to my heart. I hope you enjoy it. (Also, this hack uses Vortiene's PureRGB v.2.6.4 as a base, so the graphical tweaks extend to some of those which PureRGB introduces to the game.)

Tweaks include:
- Every trainer battle sprite (Including two completely ones, and two redesigned ones outside of those featured in the original game)
- Many, if not all overworld sprites
- Some of the Pokémon's front sprites (Including the full starter Pokémon lines, Pikachu, Raichu, Oddish, Machop, Golem, Ekans, Dratini, Dragonair, Dragonite, and likely more)
- Many tilesets
- Title screen, trainer card, and back sprites for the player character
- Changes the option to throw rocks at Safari Zone Pokémon to simply going near them, though the option will be mechanically identical
- Some minor text changes to ensure that the game still feels like it's from the '90s
- Some text references to other videogames that I'm fond of
- Restored the towns' Japanese names
- Restored the human characters' Japanese names
- Changes to the protagonist's dad's dialogue and appearance, based on my own father (PureRGB adds the protagonist's dad as an interactable character)
- Extra version with a playable female character

Acknowledgements:
- I believe the Clefairy overworld sprites might be my edit of the ones from SourApple's Sour Crystal?
- Thank you to both GuiGui and Vortiene for their guidance.
- Thank you to my good friend Fudge for compiling the project for me.
- Thank you to my dad for his help with rephrasing the protagonist's dad's dialogue.
- Thank you to Bulbapedia for documenting the Japanese character and town names.
- Playable female character sprites created by Madame Frog (aka. Hatsun) with some of my own edits.

Thank you for checking out my hack, and please share it with your fellow Pokémon fans!

Please feel free to use the sprites I've edited in your own hacks, as long as credit is given. Though, although most of the sprites I've edited seem to have simply been the original sprites from Pokemon RGBY, some of those which I've edited have been some of Vortiene's own sprites, so please give credit to him as well. As for both the male and female ranger battle sprites, I've remade those completely from scratch.

This is a purist's enhancement of Pokemon Red/Blue/Green. The goal is to enhance the original games for excellent replayability without bringing in mechanics, moves, sprites, visuals, type matchups, or pokemon that were introduced in later games. 
- It makes the bulk of the 151 original pokemon all more obtainable and usable in the early game, with better movesets and more balanced stats. 
- Many moves in the game were rebalanced or modified. When I say "rebalanced", I mean "the useless things were made more useful!" 
- There are more bug, poison, and ghost type moves available. The focus is on getting a useful set of moves available for every single pokemon in the game. 
- Front sprites were updated to be just about the best set of sprites from Red/Green/Blue/Spaceworld 1997 overall.
- All 151 pokemon are obtainable in all versions of this hack.
- HMs are deletable anytime you like and new code to prevent softlocks by deleting them was introduced.
- Some pokemon have additional types, for example, Ninetales is now FIRE/GHOST instead of FIRE. If you don't like specific type changes, you can change any specific pokemon or all of them back to normal type-wise at an NPC in indigo plateau route 23.
- [Many small quality-of-life tweaks and bugfixes](https://github.com/Vortyne/pureRGB/blob/master/FEATURES.md#quality-of-life-enhancements) were made. 
- Game bugs that can be used to your own advantage (like the leech seed/toxic bug, the hyper beam no recharge on faint bug, etc.) are unchanged, because they are quirks of the battle engine that you can use as your own tool. 
- Mew is under the truck as expected!
- Missingno and the item duplication glitch are intact - but won't corrupt your save anymore!
- An entirely new mode for the pokedex called the MOVEDEX was added. It shows data about moves you have seen in detail. You unlock the MOVEDEX in viridian city.
- CINNABAR VOLCANO was added (an area based on unused map data). It's accessible from Route 21. You can turn it off from your PC if you don't want this new area.
- There is an arena to rematch gym leaders and other important trainers after becoming CHAMP.
- There are multiple secret areas to be found after becoming CHAMP. Bills Garden, Team Rocket / Mewtwo lore, and more...
- [Many options to enhance the game visually and mechanically were added.](https://github.com/Vortyne/pureRGB/blob/master/FEATURES.md#new-options-in-the-options-menu) **(You must turn them on via the options in-game!)** Including:
  - Switchable color palettes (Choose between original colors, Super Gameboy Colors, or Pokemon Yellow Colors in-game whenever you like! Works on GBC and Super Gameboy. Yes, this romhack has GBC support!)
  - Optional Spaceworld 1997 Back Sprites
  - Optional enhanced menu sprites/overworld icons
  - Optional enhanced music (Add in cut content music like Giovanni's theme) 
  - Optional stereo panned audio (Similar to the Earphone1 option in Pokemon Yellow)
  - Optional alternate color palette pokemon based on region (catch differently colored pokemon depending on where they appear in Kanto)
  - Option to turn off the bicycle song (plays in cycling road still)
  - Option to turn on smoother higher framerate fade animations while on the GBC
  - Tweak the type matchups to be exactly like gen 1, gen 2, or a cross between them if you like directly in-game.
  - Optional in-battle experience bar
  - Option to give trainers some Stat EXP to their pokemon based on level. Makes the game a little bit harder.
  - Option to have the game track the PP of opponents (the original game they had infinite PP). Makes the game a little bit easier.
- If you're playing on GBC and have the palettes set to SGB or GBC mode, move animations will have colors! Surf will be blue, ember will be red, etc.
- There are a couple entirely new things added into the game to facilitate quality of life fixes. Including:
  - An NPC who can permanently remove CUT trees.
  - An NPC who can revive fossils for you in SAFFRON CITY so you can get fossil pokemon a bit earlier.
  - An NPC who will give you LAPRAS a bit earlier in the game.
  - An NPC who will teach you how to DIG in between towns just like you can FLY in between towns.
